    What is an Pencil?
</header>

<section>
    <h3>what is it getting used for?</h3>
    <p> an instrument for writing or drawing, consisting of a thin stick of graphite or a similar substance enclosed in a long thin piece of wood or fixed in a cylindrical case.</p>

    <h3> when was this invented? </h3>
    <p> The modern pencil was invented in 1795 by Nicholas-Jacques Conte, a scientist serving in the army of Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
    <p>The magic material that was so appropriate for the purpose was the form of pure carbon that we call graphite.</p>

    <h3> How are pencils leads manufactured and what are they made of?</h3>
    <p> The graphite lead is made out of two basic materials; these are graphite and clay. </p>
    <p> Both materials are mixed finely ground, where homogeneity and a very fine material form a good quality.</p>
    <p> Using different mixing ratios of graphite and clay leads to various hardness levels. The higher the amount of graphite the softer the lead, the higher the amount of clay the harder the lead. </p>
    <p> Burning time and heat also affect the hardness of the lead.</p>
